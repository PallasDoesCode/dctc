	  <p class="style6">The dual  enrollment students attending Industrial Electronics/Industrial Maintenance  classes at DCTC know. <br />
	    Most people don’t realize the complexity of the machinery  used in modern industry. Take the conveyor belt for example; it moves a product  from point A to point B in a facility. This is probably where most individuals’  knowledge ends.  Obviously, the conveyor  consists of a motor and a belt, but that’s too simple! Read on to see for  yourself just how complicated a conveyor belt can be.<br />
	    The modern conveyor technician is responsible for the  following:<br />
	    1. Drive system –motor, electrical supply, motor controls  for stopping, starting, speeding up, slowing down, emergency stop, thermal  over-load protection, current limiting devices such as fuses and breakers, sensing  devices such as photo-optics, limit switches, proximity switches, timers,  counters, shaft encoders (tells RPM), preventative maintenance for electronics,  last but most important, an extensive electrical knowledge to make it all work  together.<br />
	    2. Driven system—flat belt for the product to ride on,  adjustment devices to make the belt run straight, pulleys, gears, sprockets,  V-belts, or chain to connect the conveyor to the drive system, an extensive  knowledge of mechanical theory utilizing basic math functions to derive the  desired ratio between pulleys, gears, or sprockets. In addition, one must have  knowledge of proper belt deflection and alignment, chain tension, gear spacing,  preventive maintenance including lubrication, shaft inspection and alignment,  bearing inspection and proper replacement techniques, chain inspection and alignment,  as you can see this list can be rather extensive. <br />
	    The students at DCTC  are learning real world application for their course material.<br />
	    Where do you fit in? Are you good with your hands? Do you  enjoy using wrenches? Are you interested in electronics? Do you desire a  rewarding career in the Industrial Electronics / Industrial Maintenance field?</p>
