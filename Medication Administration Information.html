		<td class="bodyText"><p><strong>MEDICATIONS (prescriptions or non-prescription) will not be given until  the proper <a href="medication authorization.pdf">forms</a> have been completed. Medications must be in the original  container and properly labeled with the child's name. NO medications sent in  plastic baggies, envelopes, etc, will be given. </strong>Please give medications at  home when possible. Medications to be given regularly at school should be brought by parent at the first of each month. Please bring only enough medication for one month at  a time. At no time will medication be sent back home with a child. An adult  will need to come to school to pick medication up if  is discontinued or if  there is extra medication at the end of the school year.</p>

		  <p align="center"><strong>Medication Policy</strong></p>
		  <p>Students are not to have prescription or over-the-counter  medications in their possession during the school day or during school  sponsored events, unless the child has proper authorization for self administration.<br />
		    <br />
		    Prescription medications will be administered only if a  properly completed <em><a href="medication authorization.pdf">School Medication Prescriber/Parent Authorization Form</a></em> is completed and signed by the licensed prescriber and parent/guardian.  </p>
		  <p>Nonprescription medications, when provided, should be given following the same policies and procedures as followed for prescription medications with the exception of situations where the local medication policy requires parental/guardian permission only before administration of medication. Food supplements, natural substances and herbs are not without potential harm, including life-threatening conditions. Herbal products and dietary supplements have not been subject to the scrutiny of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and in the United States, as in most countries, dosage and purity have not been regulated for these products. It is not recommended that school personnel administer any substance that could be construed as a drug or medication, including natural remedies, herbs, and nutritional supplements, without the explicit order of an authorized prescriber, parent authorization, verification that the product is safe to administer to children in the prescribed dosage, and reasonable information regarding therapeutic and untoward effects.</p>
		  <p><strong>Procedure for Administering Medication to Students</strong></p>
		  <ol>
		    <li>A properly  completed <em><a href="medication authorization.pdf">School Medication</a></em> <a href="medication authorization.pdf"><em>Prescriber/Parent Authorization Form</em></a> must be kept on file.</li>
		    <li>Prescription  medications must be kept in the original container clearly marked with the  student's name, dosage, name of drug and directions for administration.  All over-the counter medication must be  delivered in the manufacturers' labeled container with the student's name  written on the container.  </li>
		    <li>Students  are not allowed to transport any type of medication to and from the  school.  Medication must be transported  by the parent/guardian unless other arrangements have been approved by the  principal and school nurse.  </li>
		    <li>Students  will be allowed to carry (on their person) and /or self-administer emergency  treatment medications only when the prescriber and parent/guardian have so  indicated and signed on the appropriate medication authorization form.</li>
		    <li>Any  change in medication or dosage must be documented on a new medication authorization  form, signed by the licensed prescriber and parent.  </li>
		    <li>Unused  portions of medication must be picked up from school by the  parent/guardian.  At the end of the  school year unused portions not picked up will be disposed of by school  personnel in the presence of a witness and documented.  </li>
